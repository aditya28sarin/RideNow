<!--            motivation-->
            <h3 class="aboutustitle">Motivation</h3>
            <p class="aboutustxt">Traditional taxi services do not allow users to find fellow riders or drivers who are
                heading to the same destinations or sharing the same route i.e. the allocation of drivers
                is purely random, based on availability of taxis/cabs at that particular time. They do not
                take into consideration an individualâ€™s overall travel experience and safety. Nor do they
                allow rides to be planned in advance.
            </p>

<!--            objective-->
            <p class="aboutustxt">
                Our objective is to create a ride sharing platform wherein drivers of rideshare vehicles
                can share the car with riders heading to the same destination thereby making the travel
                more affordable and help create a more enjoyable travel experience.

            <h3 class="aboutustitle">Why Is It Important To Solve?</h3>
            <p class="aboutustxt">Ride sharing has many advantages for both riders and drivers. They make travel more
                affordable (since the cost gets divided between the riders sharing the ride) and make
                travel time seem faster and enjoyable. They allow riders to choose drivers (and vice-a-
                versa) they would be more comfortable with increasing a sense of safety.
                Also, practicing ride sharing would mean fewer cars on the road which would help
                reduce CO2 emission.
